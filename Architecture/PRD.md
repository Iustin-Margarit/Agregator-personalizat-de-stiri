Here is an industry-standard template for a Product Requirements Document (PRD).

This template is designed for modern, agile development environments. It focuses on the "why" and the "what," leaving the "how" to the engineering and design teams. It's a living document, meant to be the single source of truth for a project.

---

### A Note on Modern PRDs

Before the template, remember that a modern PRD is:

* A Tool for Collaboration: It's not a contract you hand off. It's a starting point for discussion with engineering, design, marketing, and other stakeholders.
* Focused on Problems, Not Just Solutions: It clearly articulates the user problem and business need, providing context for every requirement.
* A Living Document: It will change. As you learn more through development and user feedback, update the PRD. Use a tool like Confluence, Notion, or Google Docs that supports version history and comments.

### 1. Overview: The "Why"

This section is the executive summary. Anyone should be able to read this and understand the project's purpose at a high level.

#### 1.1. Problem Statement

In today’s digital age, users are overwhelmed by the volume and fragmentation of news across platforms, websites, and sources. People must manually visit multiple sites or apps, often encountering irrelevant content, clickbait, or biased reporting. This scattered experience makes it difficult for users to efficiently stay informed about topics they care about. Many users want a tailored, clutter-free, and trustworthy way to consume news based on their interests and preferences.

#### 1.2. Proposed Solution

We will build a Personalized News Aggregator that collects news articles from various sources (via APIs and RSS feeds) and presents them in a unified interface. The platform will use user-defined preferences (e.g., topics, sources) to deliver curated content. It will prioritize relevance, readability, and personalization, enabling users to stay informed efficiently and meaningfully.

#### 1.3. Strategic Alignment / Business Case

How does this feature support broader company objectives or product goals (OKRs)? Why should we invest in this now? (aka. Cum poate produce bani aceasta aplicatie?)

This solution aligns with the increasing demand for personalized digital experiences and taps into the growing market for content aggregation tools. It supports a broader trend toward user-centered content delivery. The platform can be monetized via:

Freemium model (with premium features like advanced filtering, no ads)

Targeted interest-based advertising

### 2. Goals & Success Metrics: "How We'll Measure Success"

Define what success looks like in measurable terms. Differentiate between the goals (the outcome) and the metrics (the measurement).

#### 2.1. Goals

What are the primary and secondary goals? Think in terms of user outcomes and business impact.

* User Goal: Allow users to access personalized, relevant news content from multiple sources in under 30 seconds per session, eliminating the need to manually browse various websites.
* Business Goal: Increase user engagement and daily retention by offering a customizable and streamlined news consumption experience that caters to niche audiences and content preferences.
* Technical Goal: Build a modular and scalable content aggregation engine that can easily integrate additional data sources (APIs, RSS) and support future features like summarization, sentiment analysis, or push notifications.

#### 2.2. Success Metrics (KPIs) (NU FOLOSIM ACEASTA SECTIUNE INCA)

How will you know you've achieved your goals? These should be specific, measurable, and trackable.

| Metric               | Description & Target                                                                           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Adoption Rate        | % of target users who use the dashboard >2 times in their first week.Target: 40%               |
| Task Completion Rate | % of users who successfully create and save a dashboard view.Target: 95%                       |
| Time-to-Value        | Average time it takes a user to get meaningful insight from the dashboard.Target: < 60 seconds |
| Retention Impact     | 3-month retention rate of users who adopt the dashboard vs. those who don't.Target: +5% lift   |
| Support Tickets      | Reduction in tickets related to "reporting" or "project overview."Target: -10%                 |

### 3. Target Audience: "Who We're Building For"

Describe the target user(s) for this feature. Link to full persona documents if they exist.

* ### Primary Persona: "Andrei the Avid News Consumer"

Andrei is a 28-year-old software engineer who reads news daily across multiple topics, including tech, world politics, and science. He’s frustrated with the time it takes to visit different websites and sort through irrelevant or duplicate content. He values customization, speed, and clean design.

Needs: A central, clean, fast platform where he can see relevant news based on his personal interests.

Pain Points: Too many tabs, irrelevant news, ads, repetitive content.

Goals: Stay informed quickly and with minimal distraction.

* Secondary Persona:"Alexandra the Casual Reader"

Alexandra is a 35-year-old marketing professional who only wants the top news in a few key areas like business and lifestyle. She checks news 1-2 times per day during breaks and dislikes overwhelming or technical interfaces. She prefers mobile-first design and easy digestibility.

Needs: Simplicity, curated content, no setup hassle.

Pain Points: Overload of low-quality or sensational news, non-personalized apps.

Goals: Catch up on what matters in 5–10 minutes.

Of course. Here is the "Requirements & Scope" section of the PRD, fully updated based on the new list of user stories you provided.

The structure has been revised to group stories by priority, add new features like commenting and saving articles, and adjust the "Out of Scope" section to reflect these changes.

#### 4.2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

These are system-level constraints, often called the "-ilities."

* Performance:
  * The main news feed must load in under 2 seconds for up to 50 articles.
  * User interactions (liking, saving, filtering) must provide instant UI feedback.
* Security:
  * All user data (accounts, preferences, saved articles, comments) must be securely stored and encrypted at rest and in transit.
  * Authentication must follow best practices (e.g., salted password hashes, HTTPS, JWTs).
* Mobile Responsiveness:
  * The web application must be fully responsive and provide an optimal user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop displays.
  * Touch targets and gestures must be optimized for small screens.
* Accessibility:
  * The UI must strive to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
  * The application must support keyboard navigation and be compatible with screen readers.
  * User-configurable options for font-size and theme (light/dark) must be available.
* Localization:
  * All UI text (buttons, labels, messages) must be abstracted into translation keys to facilitate future localization. The default and initial launch language is English.

#### 4.3. Out of Scope (important!)

Be explicit about what you are not building to prevent scope creep and manage expectations.

* Native iOS/Android apps (The product is a responsive web app only).
* Voice-assisted news playback / text-to-speech functionality.
* Advanced user analytics (e.g., time spent per article, scroll depth tracking).
* Multi-language news content (The UI can be localized, but the articles themselves will be in English only for the initial launch).
* Multi-region/country-specific news feeds.
* Advanced recommendation engine based on implicit behavior (e.g., click patterns, read time). Recommendations will only be based on explicit user preferences and "likes."
* Comment moderation tools or user reporting functionality for comments (for the initial implementation of US-09).

### 5. Design & User Experience: "How It Looks & Feels"

This section connects the requirements to the visual and interaction design. The PRD is the source of truth for what to design; Figma/Sketch is the source of truth for how it looks.

* Link to Figma/Sketch File: [Link to the full design file]
* User Flow Diagram: [Embed or link to a diagram showing the user's journey, from discovery to successful use]
* Key Wireframes/Prototypes:
  * Empty State: What the user sees the first time they visit. [Embed image/link]
  * Dashboard Creation: The flow for selecting projects. [Embed image/link]
  * Populated Dashboard: The main view with data. [Embed image/link]
* 

### 6. Go-to-Market & Launch Plan (NU FOLOSIM ACEASTA SECTIUNE INCA)

How will you release this to the world? This ensures cross-functional alignment.

* Phasing:
  * Internal Alpha: [Date] - Release to internal employees for dogfooding.
  * Closed Beta: [Date] - Release to a select group of power users.
  * General Availability (GA): [Date] - Full release to 100% of users.
* 
* Dependencies:
  * Marketing: Blog post and in-app announcement need to be ready by [Date].
  * Support: Help documentation and agent training must be completed by [Date].
  * Sales: One-pager on new functionality for sales enablement.
* 

### 7. Future Work & Open Questions (neimportant)

A place to acknowledge what's next and what you still don't know. This fosters transparency.

#### 7.1. Future Iterations (V2, V3)

What ideas are already on the roadmap for after this initial launch?

* Customizable columns in the dashboard.
* Export to CSV/PDF.
* Conditional formatting (e.g., turn a project red if it's overdue).

#### 7.2. Open Questions & Assumptions

List any open questions or assumptions that need to be resolved or validated.

* Question: What is the technical performance impact of refreshing data for 50+ projects at once? (Needs investigation by Eng).
* Assumption: We assume users want a table view first, rather than a card-based or timeline view. (Will validate in Beta).
* Question: Do we need to support sharing with specific people, or is a public link sufficient for V1? (Needs discussion with security/users).
