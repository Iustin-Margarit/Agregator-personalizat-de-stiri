## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- **Source Filtering Logic:** Implemented source filtering that works in combination with category, search, and date filters
- **UI Design:** Sources are grouped by category with select/clear all functionality for better user experience
- **Performance:** All filtering is applied at the database level using Supabase's operators for optimal performance
- **Filter Interaction:** All four filter types (category, search, date, source) work seamlessly together
- **State Management:** Proper state management for all filter types with debounced search and optimized re-renders
