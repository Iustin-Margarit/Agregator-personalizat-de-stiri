# Active Development Context

## Current Work Focus:
- **Completed Onboarding Flow:** The full user onboarding experience has been implemented, from database setup to the frontend UI and redirection logic.

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- **Core Experience Next:** With authentication and onboarding complete, the project is ready to move to the most critical phase: building the core news feed experience.

## Recent Changes:
- **Completed Onboarding UI and Logic (Tasks 2.2, 2.3, 2.4):**
  - Created the `/onboarding` page and the `OnboardingForm` component.
  - Implemented logic to save user category preferences and update their profile.
  - Added middleware to redirect new, un-onboarded users to the `/onboarding` page.
- Marked all tasks in Epic 2 as complete in `tasks_plan.md`.

## Next Steps:
- **Begin Core News Feed Epic (Epic 3):** Start work on the "Core News Feed Experience" epic. The first task is **Task 3.1: Set up the data ingestion pipeline.**
