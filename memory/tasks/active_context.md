# Active Development Context

## Current Work Focus:
- **Admin Panel Implementation Complete:** A comprehensive admin panel with secure role-based access, user management, and content management has been implemented, debugged, and hardened.
- **Data Integrity and UX  Enhanced:** Implemented several fixes to ensure data consistency and a better user experience, including handling for disabled sources, "ghost" saved articles, and a new saved article counter.

## Recent Changes (2025-07-07):
- **Implemented Admin Panel (Epic 9):**
  - Added Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to the database.
  - Built protected frontend routes and UI for user and content management.
  - Patched a critical "admin lockout" vulnerability.
  - Ensured that disabling a news source correctly hides its articles from all user-facing views (feed, saved articles, filters).
  - Added a banner to allow users to clear saved articles from disabled sources ("ghost slots").
  - Added a saved article counter to the UI and a scalable limit to the database.
  - Cleaned up deprecated data from the database.
- **Resolved Production/Local DB Mismatch:** Identified and fixed a critical bug where the local development environment was pointed at the production database, and synchronized the production database schema with all local migrations.

## Next Steps:
- **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY:** Proceed with the Production Deployment Checklist as detailed in `tasks_plan.md`.
- **CRITICAL:** Ensure all environment variables are correctly configured for the production deployment.
- **Future Development:** After successful deployment, development can continue with Phase 2 features, such as Social and Community Features (Epic 4).
