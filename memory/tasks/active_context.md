# Active Development Context

## Current Work Focus:
- **Task 3.4 Complete:** Successfully implemented the complete liking functionality including analytics tracking.
- **Automated Ingestion Complete:** Implemented GitHub Actions workflow for automated news ingestion every 2 hours.
- **Full User Engagement System:** The app now supports both saving and liking articles with comprehensive analytics.
- **Production-Ready Scheduling:** Automated news ingestion system ready for deployment with proper monitoring and error handling.
- **Ready for Next Features:** With complete engagement functionality and automated content updates, ready to move to article detail views or other features.

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- **Source Filtering Logic:** Implemented source filtering that works in combination with category, search, and date filters
- **UI Design:** Sources are grouped by category with select/clear all functionality for better user experience
- **Performance:** All filtering is applied at the database level using Supabase's operators for optimal performance
- **Filter Interaction:** All four filter types (category, search, date, source) work seamlessly together
- **State Management:** Proper state management for all filter types with debounced search and optimized re-renders

## Recent Changes (2025-07-01):
- **Completed Task 3.3.1:** Created comprehensive `FeedFilters` UI component with category selection, clear/show all buttons, and expandable design
- **Completed Task 3.3.2:** Implemented state management for selected categories with proper handlers for filter changes
- **Completed Task 3.3.3:** Updated data fetching logic to re-query articles based on selected categories
- **Completed Task 3.3.4:** Added search functionality with debounced input, filtering articles by title and content
- **Completed Task 3.3.5:** Added date range filtering with four options (All Time, Today, Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days)
  - **Fixed Date Range Bug:** Changed from calendar-based ranges to relative ranges to ensure articles are always available
  - **Improved UX:** "Last 7 Days" and "Last 30 Days" are more intuitive than "This Week" and "This Month"
- **Completed Task 3.3.6:** Added source-specific filtering functionality
  - **Source Grouping:** Sources are organized by category for better navigation
  - **Select/Clear All:** Added buttons to quickly select or clear all sources within a category
  - **Filter Integration:** Source filtering works seamlessly with all other filter types
  - **State Management:** Added `selectedSourceIds` state and proper handlers for source filter changes
  - **Data Fetching:** Updated `fetchFilteredArticles` and `loadMoreArticles` to include source filtering logic
  - **UI Polish:** Added newspaper icon and proper status messages for source filtering
- **Fixed Category Mapping Bug:** Resolved issue where articles showed "Unknown" categories after filter changes
  - **Root Cause:** Old sample articles had null `source_id` values, causing failed category lookups
  - **Solution:** Cleaned up articles with null `source_id` and made category mapping more robust
  - **Database Cleanup:** Removed 5 old sample articles, keeping 477 properly linked articles
  - **Code Fix:** Enhanced category mapping to handle both object and array formats from Supabase relationships
- **Completed Task 3.4.1:** Created `likes` table with proper RLS policies and indexes
  - **Database Schema:** Added `likes` table with `user_id`, `article_id`, and `created_at` columns
  - **Security:** Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies for user-specific access
  - **Performance:** Added composite unique index on `user_id` and `article_id`
- **Completed Task 3.4.2:** Added Like button to `ArticleCard` with optimistic UI updates
  - **UI Integration:** Heart icon that changes color when liked/unliked
  - **Optimistic Updates:** Immediate visual feedback before database confirmation
  - **State Management:** `isLiked` state with proper initialization and updates
- **Completed Task 3.4.3:** Implemented backend logic for like/unlike operations
  - **Database Operations:** Insert/delete operations in the `likes` table
  - **Error Handling:** Proper error handling with fallback to previous state
  - **Performance:** Efficient database queries with minimal overhead
- **Completed Automated News Ingestion:** Implemented GitHub Actions workflow for production-ready scheduling
  - **GitHub Actions Workflow:** Created `.github/workflows/news-ingestion.yml` with 2-hour scheduling
  - **API Integration:** Built `app/api/trigger-ingestion/route.ts` for secure ingestion triggering
  - **Security:** Implemented authentication with `CRON_SECRET` for secure automated requests
  - **Architecture:** GitHub Actions → Next.js API → Supabase Edge Function → RSS Feeds
  - **Monitoring:** Comprehensive logging and error handling with detailed status reporting
  - **Documentation:** Created complete setup guide in `docs/automated-ingestion-setup.md`
  - **Manual Testing:** Supports both scheduled and manual workflow triggers
  - **Production Ready:** Solves the "no news for today" issue with automated content updates
- **Completed Task 3.4.4:** Implemented analytics system to track like patterns for personalization
  - **Analytics System:** Created comprehensive `Analytics` class in `lib/analytics.ts`
  - **Database Schema:** Added `analytics_data` JSONB column to `profiles` table with GIN index
  - **Event Tracking:** Track like/unlike events with article category and source information
  - **User Patterns:** Generate user preference patterns based on like activity
  - **Aggregated Stats:** Provide system-wide analytics including most liked categories and articles
  - **Integration:** Analytics automatically triggered on like/unlike actions in `ArticleCard`
  - **Privacy-First:** Analytics stored in user's own profile, no cross-user data sharing
- **Resolved Supabase Port Conflicts:** Fixed Windows reserved port issues with Supabase local development
  - **Root Cause:** Default Supabase ports conflicted with Windows reserved port ranges
  - **Solution:** Updated `supabase/config.toml` to use alternative ports (API: 58321, DB: 58322, Studio: 58323)
  - **Environment:** Ensured Docker Desktop compatibility and stable local development setup

## Next Steps:
- **Ready for Production Deployment:** All core features complete, automated scheduling implemented and documented
- **Deployment Critical Path:** Follow `DEPLOYMENT.md` and `memory/tasks/tasks_plan.md` deployment checklist
- **Post-Deployment:** Begin Task 3.6 (Article Detail View) or other advanced features
- **Monitoring:** Ensure automated news ingestion runs successfully every 2 hours after deployment
