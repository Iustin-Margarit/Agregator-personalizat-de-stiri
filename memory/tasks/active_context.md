# Active Development Context

## Current Work Focus:
- **Login Issue Resolved:** The critical login issue, where credentials disappeared and login failed due to Next.js chunk loading errors, has been diagnosed and resolved through a clean rebuild.
- **Completed Onboarding Flow:** The full user onboarding experience has been implemented, from database setup to the frontend UI and redirection logic.
- **Data Ingestion Pipeline:** Core data ingestion infrastructure has been set up including database tables, RSS sources, and Edge Function deployment.

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- **Core Experience Next:** With authentication and onboarding complete, the project is ready to move to the most critical phase: building the core news feed experience.
- **Security Status:** All security vulnerabilities have been resolved. npm audit reports 0 vulnerabilities as of 2025-06-30.

## Recent Changes:
- **Fixed Login Bug (2025-06-27):** Resolved the login issue by performing a clean rebuild of the Next.js project (clearing `.next`, `node_modules`, `package-lock.json`, reinstalling, and restarting `npm run dev`).
- **Completed Onboarding UI and Logic (Tasks 2.2, 2.3, 2.4):**
  - Created the `/onboarding` page and the `OnboardingForm` component.
  - Implemented logic to save user category preferences and update their profile.
  - Added middleware to redirect new, un-onboarded users to the `/onboarding` page.
- Marked all tasks in Epic 2 as complete in `tasks_plan.md`.
- **Resolved Security Vulnerability (Task 1.10 - 2025-06-30):** Verified that no security vulnerabilities currently exist in the project. npm audit reports 0 vulnerabilities.
- **Completed Data Ingestion Setup (Task 3.1 - 2025-06-30):**
  - Created database tables: `sources`, `article_categories`, and enhanced `articles` table
  - Populated sources table with 14+ RSS feeds from major news outlets
  - Developed and deployed `news-ingestion` Edge Function with RSS parsing logic
  - Implemented duplicate detection using content hashing

## Next Steps:
- **Complete Data Ingestion Pipeline:** Fix Edge Function authentication issues and test the RSS ingestion
- **Begin Task 3.2:** Build the main feed page UI to display articles from the ingestion pipeline
