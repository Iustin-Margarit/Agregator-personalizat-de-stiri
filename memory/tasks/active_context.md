# Active Development Context

## Current Work Focus:
- **Finalizing Authentication UX:** The core authentication flow is now functionally complete and user-friendly, with the implementation of password reset and loading state feedback.

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- **Social Logins as Future Work:** While Task 1.9 (Social Logins) is planned, it is a lower priority (P2) and can be addressed after the core MVP features are in place. We will now proceed to the next major epic.

## Recent Changes:
- Implemented the full password reset flow (Task 1.7).
- Added loading indicators to all authentication forms (Task 1.8).
- Marked tasks 1.7 and 1.8 as complete in `tasks_plan.md`.

## Next Steps:
- **Begin Onboarding Epic (Epic 2):** Start work on the "Onboarding & Personalization Setup" epic. The first task is **Task 2.1: Create the `categories` and `user_preferred_categories` tables in Supabase.**
