# Active Development Context

## Current Work Focus:
- **Login Issue Resolved:** The critical login issue, where credentials disappeared and login failed due to Next.js chunk loading errors, has been diagnosed and resolved through a clean rebuild.
- **Completed Onboarding Flow:** The full user onboarding experience has been implemented, from database setup to the frontend UI and redirection logic.

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- **Core Experience Next:** With authentication and onboarding complete, the project is ready to move to the most critical phase: building the core news feed experience.
- **Security Vulnerability:** A critical security vulnerability was identified during `npm install`. This needs to be addressed as a high-priority task.

## Recent Changes:
- **Fixed Login Bug (2025-06-27):** Resolved the login issue by performing a clean rebuild of the Next.js project (clearing `.next`, `node_modules`, `package-lock.json`, reinstalling, and restarting `npm run dev`).
- **Completed Onboarding UI and Logic (Tasks 2.2, 2.3, 2.4):**
  - Created the `/onboarding` page and the `OnboardingForm` component.
  - Implemented logic to save user category preferences and update their profile.
  - Added middleware to redirect new, un-onboarded users to the `/onboarding` page.
- Marked all tasks in Epic 2 as complete in `tasks_plan.md`.
- Added Task 1.10 to `tasks_plan.md` to address the critical npm audit vulnerability.

## Next Steps:
- **Address Critical Security Vulnerability (Task 1.10):** Prioritize running `npm audit fix --force` and verifying its impact.
- **Begin Core News Feed Epic (Epic 3):** Start work on the "Core News Feed Experience" epic. The first task is **Task 3.1: Set up the data ingestion pipeline.**
