## 🚀 PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### Pre-Deployment Requirements:


* [X] ✅ **MVP Features Complete:** Core news feed, authentication, onboarding, saving, liking
* [X] ✅ **Database Schema Ready:** All migrations created and tested locally
* [X] ✅ **Automated Ingestion Code Ready:** GitHub Actions workflow and API endpoint implemented

### 🔧 DEPLOYMENT STEPS (Execute in Order):


#### Step 1: Deploy Application Infrastructure

1. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   * Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
   * Configure build settings (Next.js)
   * Deploy and get production URL (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)
2. **Configure Production Supabase:**
   * Create production Supabase project (if not already done)
   * Apply all database migrations to production
   * Get production Supabase URL and anon key

#### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables


* **Vercel Environment Variables:**
  ```
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-production-anon-key
  CRON_SECRET=your-strong-random-secret-token
  ```

**GitHub Repository Secrets:**

* Go to Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
* Add secrets:
  ```
  VERCEL_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
  CRON_SECRET=your-strong-random-secret-token (same as Vercel)
  ```

#### Step 3: Test Automated News Ingestion (CRITICAL)


* **Manual Test:**

  * Go to GitHub → Actions → "News Ingestion Scheduler"
  * Click "Run workflow" → "Run workflow"
  * Wait for completion (should show green checkmark)
* **Verify Results:**

  * Check GitHub Actions logs for success message
  * Visit production app and verify fresh articles appear
  * Check Vercel function logs for any errors
* **Test Production API:**

  ```shell
  curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/trigger-ingestion \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token"

  ```

#### Step 4: Verify Automatic Scheduling


1. **Wait for Next Scheduled Run:**
   * Automatic runs happen every 2 hours at :00 minutes
   * Check GitHub Actions history for automatic execution
2. **Monitor for 24 Hours:**
   * Ensure 12 automatic runs complete successfully
   * Verify fresh articles continue to appear

#### Step 5: Configure Monitoring & Alerts


1. **GitHub Actions Notifications:**
   * Go to Repository → Settings → Notifications
   * Enable email notifications for workflow failures
2. **Vercel Function Monitoring:**
   * Monitor function execution logs
   * Set up alerts for function failures

### ⚠️ CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA:


* [ ] **Fresh Articles:** New articles appear every 2 hours
* [ ] **No Stale Content:** Users see current news, not old articles
* [ ] **Automatic Operation:** No manual intervention required
* [ ] **Error Recovery:** Failed runs don't break the system
* [ ] **Monitoring Active:** Team notified of any failures

### 🆘 ROLLBACK PLAN:

If automated ingestion fails after deployment:

1. **Immediate:** Manually trigger ingestion via GitHub Actions
2. **Short-term:** Use external cron service (cron-job.org) to call API endpoint
3. **Long-term:** Debug and fix GitHub Actions workflow

### 📚 REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION:


* **Setup Guide:** `docs/automated-ingestion-setup.md`
* **API Documentation:** `/app/api/trigger-ingestion/route.ts` comments
* **Workflow Configuration:** `.github/workflows/news-ingestion.yml`

### 🎯 POST-DEPLOYMENT VALIDATION:


* [ ] Visit production app and verify fresh articles from today
* [ ] Test user registration and onboarding flow
* [ ] Test article liking and saving functionality
* [ ] Verify analytics tracking is working
* [ ] Check that all 7 news categories have recent articles
* [ ] Monitor GitHub Actions for 48 hours to ensure stability

**🚨 IMPORTANT:** The automated news
ingestion is CRITICAL for user experience. Without it, users will see
stale content and the app will appear broken.
