## 🚀 PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### Pre-Deployment Requirements:
- [x] ✅ **MVP Features Complete:** Core news feed, authentication, onboarding, saving, liking
- [x] ✅ **Database Schema Ready:** All migrations created and tested locally
- [x] ✅ **Automated Ingestion Code Ready:** GitHub Actions workflow and API endpoint implemented

### 🔧 DEPLOYMENT STEPS (Execute in Order):

#### Step 1: Deploy Application Infrastructure
1. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   - Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
   - Configure build settings (Next.js)
   - Deploy and get production URL (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)

2. **Configure Production Supabase:**
   - Create production Supabase project (if not already done)
   - Apply all database migrations to production
   - Get production Supabase URL and anon key

#### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables
1. **Vercel Environment Variables:**
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-production-anon-key
   CRON_SECRET=your-strong-random-secret-token
   ```

2. **GitHub Repository Secrets:**
   - Go to Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Add secrets:
     ```
     VERCEL_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
     CRON_SECRET=your-strong-random-secret-token (same as Vercel)
     ```

#### Step 3: Test Automated News Ingestion (CRITICAL)
1. **Manual Test:**
   - Go to GitHub → Actions → "News Ingestion Scheduler"
   - Click "Run workflow" → "Run workflow"
   - Wait for completion (should show green checkmark)

2. **Verify Results:**
   - Check GitHub Actions logs for success message
   - Visit production app and verify fresh articles appear
   - Check Vercel function logs for any errors

3. **Test Production API:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/trigger-ingestion \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token"
   ```

#### Step 4: Verify Automatic Scheduling
1. **Wait for Next Scheduled Run:**
   - Automatic runs happen every 2 hours at :00 minutes
   - Check GitHub Actions history for automatic execution

2. **Monitor for 24 Hours:**
   - Ensure 12 automatic runs complete successfully
   - Verify fresh articles continue to appear

#### Step 5: Configure Monitoring & Alerts
1. **GitHub Actions Notifications:**
   - Go to Repository → Settings → Notifications
   - Enable email notifications for workflow failures

2. **Vercel Function Monitoring:**
   - Monitor function execution logs
   - Set up alerts for function failures

### ⚠️ CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- [ ] **Fresh Articles:** New articles appear every 2 hours
- [ ] **No Stale Content:** Users see current news, not old articles
- [ ] **Automatic Operation:** No manual intervention required
- [ ] **Error Recovery:** Failed runs don't break the system
- [ ] **Monitoring Active:** Team notified of any failures

### 🆘 ROLLBACK PLAN:
If automated ingestion fails after deployment:
1. **Immediate:** Manually trigger ingestion via GitHub Actions
2. **Short-term:** Use external cron service (cron-job.org) to call API endpoint
3. **Long-term:** Debug and fix GitHub Actions workflow

### 📚 REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION:
- **Setup Guide:** `docs/automated-ingestion-setup.md`
- **API Documentation:** `/app/api/trigger-ingestion/route.ts` comments
- **Workflow Configuration:** `.github/workflows/news-ingestion.yml`

### 🎯 POST-DEPLOYMENT VALIDATION:
- [ ] Visit production app and verify fresh articles from today
- [ ] Test user registration and onboarding flow
- [ ] Test article liking and saving functionality
- [ ] Verify analytics tracking is working
- [ ] Check that all 7 news categories have recent articles
- [ ] Monitor GitHub Actions for 48 hours to ensure stability

**🚨 IMPORTANT:** The automated news ingestion is CRITICAL for user experience. Without it, users will see stale content and the app will appear broken.
