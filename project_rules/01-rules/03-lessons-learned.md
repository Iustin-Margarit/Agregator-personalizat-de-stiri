## Lessons Learned from this Interaction:

- **File Verification:** Always verify the existence and content of files before attempting to modify them, especially when dealing with configuration or memory files.
- **Tool Selection:** Choose the correct tool for the task at hand, considering the specific requirements of each tool (e.g., `write_to_file` vs. `replace_in_file`).
- **MCP Server Verification:** Confirm MCP server availability and correct configuration before attempting to use its tools.
- **Task Planning:** Document tasks clearly in `tasks/tasks_plan.md` before starting implementation.
- **Follow Instructions Precisely:** Adhere strictly to the instructions and guidelines provided, especially regarding tool usage and mode switching.
- **Next.js Debugging - Missing Chunks:** When encountering 404 errors for `_next/static/chunks/*.js` files, especially after `npm run dev` appears to compile, the root cause is often a corrupted build cache or `node_modules`. A clean rebuild (stopping dev server, deleting `.next`, `node_modules`, `package-lock.json`, reinstalling, and restarting dev server) is an effective first step.
- **Windows Command Compatibility:** Be aware of the differences in command syntax between `cmd.exe` and PowerShell when executing commands on Windows. Use PowerShell-compatible commands like `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force` for robust directory/file deletion.
- **Stuck Commands:** If a command hangs unexpectedly, it may indicate a file lock or system issue. Prompt the user for manual intervention if necessary to unblock the process.
